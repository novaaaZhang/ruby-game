This is a decompression game about monster eating circles.
For each time the game has 100 circles appearing on the screen randomly, click them as much as possible! After few seconds it will disappear, and new circles will appear again. Play as much rounds as you wish!
You can download the files and open game3.rb in vscode to run.
Good luck.
